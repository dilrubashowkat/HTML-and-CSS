      <h1> About me</h1>
      <p>
       I am strategic, highly focused, goal oriented person and an achiever. In my free time, I practice writing, listen to music,  and learn something new. I believe with my clear understanding of user studies (asking the right questions and choosing the right research methods/tools) I can help your company to achieve your goal. I am highly enthusiastic about human factors research and I have 2 years of research experience (qualitative and quantitative) in user studies. Previously, I have worked in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
