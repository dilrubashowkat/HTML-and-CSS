            <p>
                Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. In English, it carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the "Red Planet"[13][14] because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[15] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.
